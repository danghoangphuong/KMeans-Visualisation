:pushpin: To use this GUI, follow these steps:

Step 1: create randomly data points by clicking LEFT MOUSE BUTTON on the panel\
Step 2: generate K using "+" / "-" button \
Step 3: then you click on "Random cluster" button \
Step 4: click on "Run" button. This button was written without using external library (I meantion Scikit-learn here)\
:rotating_light: I used Scikit-learn library with "Algorithm" button to compare the result to "Run" button\
:fire: Use "Reset" button if you want to clear screen\
:rotating_light: Click on "Compress picture" then 2 pictures will appear. On your LEFT, it is the original picture, besides, there will be a compressed picture. I used K=4 when compressed this picture, you can adjust the number of K in code :boom:\
